A walkthrough of the ins & outs of Amazon's hosted NoSQL database.

## Shout-outs

This project was inspired by Craig Kerstien's [PostgresGuide.com](http://postgresguide.com), which was very helpful to me when I was learning to program.

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator that uses React. I used the [gatsby-starter-docs](https://github.com/ericwindmill/gatsby-starter-docs) template created by Eric Windmill, which was a huge help because I'm terrible at HTML & CSS.
